    <h2>Grandma's lasagna</h2>
        <p>This recipe has been passed down in my family for millenia. It has been said that Da'vinci was inspired by the combination of noods and sauce and sausage and beef, so much so that he went on to paint the Mona Lisa. So yeah, this lasagna is pretty damn good.</p>
        <p>Originally, the word lasagna was used to describe a pot in which food was being cooked rather than the pasta itself.  Lasagna recipes have been around for ages, dating back to as early as the thirteenth century.  Today, lasagnas come in all kinds of varieties from veggies and cream sauces to traditional sauce and cheese lasagnas as well as meat lasagnas.Originated in Italy during the middle ages, lasagna has been attributed to the city of Naples.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 pound sweet Italian sausage</li>
            <li>¾ pound lean ground beef</li>
            <li>½ cup minced onion</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
            <li>1 (28 ounce) can crushed tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 (6 ounce) cans tomato paste</li>
            <li>2 (6.5 ounce) cans canned tomato sauce</li>
            <li>½ cup water</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li> 
            <li>1½ teaspoons dried basil leaves</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon fennel seeds</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon Italian seasoning</li>
            <li>1½ teaspoons salt, divided, or to taste</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>4 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley</li>
            <li>12 lasagna noodles</li>
            <li>16 ounces ricotta cheese</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>¾ pound mozzarella cheese, sliced</li>
            <li>¾ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        </ul>    
    <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>In a Dutch oven, cook sausage, ground beef, onion, and garlic over medium heat until well browned. Stir in crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, tomato sauce, and water. Season with sugar, basil, fennel seeds, Italian seasoning, 1 teaspoon salt, pepper, and 2 tablespoons parsley. Simmer, covered, for about 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally.</li>
            <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook lasagna noodles in boiling water for 8 to 10 minutes. Drain noodles, and rinse with cold water. In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese with egg, remaining parsley, and 1/2 teaspoon salt.</li>
            <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>To assemble, spread 1 1/2 cups of meat sauce in the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Arrange 6 noodles lengthwise over meat sauce. Spread with one half of the ricotta cheese mixture. Top with a third of mozzarella cheese slices. Spoon 1 1/2 cups meat sauce over mozzarella, and sprinkle with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray, or make sure the foil does not touch the cheese.</li>
            <li>Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove foil, and bake an additional 25 minutes. Cool for 15 minutes before serving.</li>
        </ol>
